    Privately owned public spaces, also known by the acronym POPS, are outdoor  and
    indoor spaces provided for public enjoyment by private owners in exchange  for bonus
    floor area or waivers, an incentive first introduced into New York City's  zoning
    regulations in 1961. To find out more about POPS, visit the Department  of City
    Planning's website at http://nyc.gov/pops. This database contains
    detailed  information about each privately owned public space in New York City.
