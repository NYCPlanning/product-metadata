description: >
  Privately owned public spaces, also known by the acronym POPS, are outdoor 
  and indoor spaces provided for public enjoyment by private owners in exchange 
  for bonus floor area or waivers, an incentive first introduced into New York City's 
  zoning regulations in 1961. To find out more about POPS, visit the Department 
  of City Planning's website at http://nyc.gov/pops. This database contains detailed 
  information about each privately owned public space in New York City.

  Data Source: Privately Owned Public Space Database (2018), owned and maintained 
  by the New York City Department of City Planning and created in collaboration 
  with Jerold S. Kayden and The Municipal Art Society of New York.
