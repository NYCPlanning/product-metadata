display_name: Housing Database by 2020 CDTA
summary: 'Net change in housing units arising from new buildings, demolitions, or
  alterations for specified geography (Census Block, Census Tract, City Council district,
  Community District, Community District Tabulation Area (CDTA), Neighborhood Tabulation
  Area (NTA). These tables are aggregated from the DCP Housing Database, which is
  derived from Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition
  jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is
  calculated as the sum of all three construction job types that add or remove residential
  units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to determine
  the change in legal housing units across time and space. <br>

  <b>NOTE: Housing Database by PUMA has been sunset as of the 20q4 release. Anyone
  looking for housing database at the PUMA level should use the Housing Database by
  2020 CDTA dataset, which is a similar geography but not an exact equivalent.</b><br>
