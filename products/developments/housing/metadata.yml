  >Housing Database</a> contains all NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) approved housing\
  \ construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010.\
  \ It includes the three primary construction job types that add or remove residential\
  \ units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to determine\
  \ the change in legal housing units across time and space. Records in the Housing\
  \ Database Project-Level Files are geocoded to the greatest level of precision possible,\
  \ subject to numerous quality assurance and control checks, recoded for usability,\
  \ and joined to other housing data sources relevant to city planners and analysts.\n\
  Data are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each\
  \ year.\nPlease see DCP\u2019s annual Housing Production Snapshot summarizing findings\
  \ from the 21Q4 data release <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1c9138dc24064b2e8142ff156345a719\"\

  \ used political and statistical boundaries (Census Block, Census Tract, City Council\
  \ district, Community District, Community District Tabulation Area (CDTA), Neighborhood\
  \ Tabulation Area (NTA). These tables are aggregated from the DCP Housing Database\
  \ Project-Level Files, which is derived from Department of Buildings (DOB) approved\
  \ housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January\
  \ 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is calculated as the sum of all three construction\
  \ job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations,\
