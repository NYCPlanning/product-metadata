    The NYC Department of City Planning's (DCP) <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-housing-database.page#housingdevelopmentproject">Housing Database</a> contains all NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. It includes the three primary construction job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions,  and can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space. Records in the Housing Database Project-Level Files  are geocoded to the greatest level of precision possible, subject to numerous quality assurance and control checks, recoded for usability,  and joined to other housing data sources relevant to city planners and analysts.
    Data are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each year.
    Please see DCP's annual Housing Production Snapshot summarizing findings from the 21Q4 data release  <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1c9138dc24064b2e8142ff156345a719">here. Additional Housing and Economic analyses are also  <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/housing-economy/housing-economy.page">available</a>.

    The DOB job application number assigned when the applicant begins the application. 
    This is the unique identifier for the application submitted to the Department of Buildings (DOB). 
    It may contain several work types, and more work types may be added as the application review and the work continues. 
    It is a 9-digit number where the first digit indicates the borough where the building is located.
  example: '320241010'
- id: job_type
  name: Job_Type
  data_type: text
  description: DOB's type category for the job application.
  example: Alteration
  values:
  - value: Alteration
    description: a major alteration that will change the use, egress, or occupancy of the building.
  - value: New Building
    description: an application to build a new structure. “NB” cannot be selected if any existing building elements are to remain—for example a part of an old foundation, a portion of a façade that will be incorporated into the construction, etc.
  - value: Demolition
    description: an application to fully or partially demolish an existing building. Note that many demolition permits are only for partial demolitions and for garages (these are also captured).
- id: residflag
  name: ResidFlag
  data_type: text
  description: >
    This field is used to identify jobs in buildings containing residential uses. 
    A value of "residential" indicates that the job affects residential units in some way through new construction, alteration, or demolition. 
    Only those jobs with a value of "residential" are included in the housing database. 
    Manual research was conducted at DCP to help ensure that all work on buildings with residences receive this flag, though some records may remain misclassified.
  example: Residential
  values:
  - value: Residential
- id: nonresflag
  name: NonresFlag
  data_type: text
  description: >
    This field is used to identify jobs in buildings containing non-residential uses. 
    A value of "non-residential" indicates that the job affects some use type beyond residential, including commercial, industrial, or community facility uses. 
    Mixed-use buildings will have values in both the Resid_Flag and Nonresid_Flag, since they contain both residential and nonresidential uses, but having flags 
    in both of those columns does not necessarily mean that it is a mixed-use development since the flags do not distinguish between the initial and proposed uses in the building.
  example: Non-Residential
  values:
  - value: Non-Residential
- id: job_status
  name: Job_Status
  data_type: text
  description: |
    DCP recode of DOB's status label. This describes the status of the job at the date of the data vintage. For example, a job marked as "3. Permitted" was at that status as of June 30, 2020 if using version 20Q2 of the DCP Housing Database. More details on each DOB status is available here:

    https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/bisjobstatus.pdf

    Jobs typically move through status A through X over time as they reach certain approval milestones:

    1. Filed: job application is at status A - G at the time of publication. Application submitted, but review is not yet in progress.

    2. Plan Examination: application is at status H - P. Plan examination is in progress, but not yet approved.

    3. Permitted: application is at status Q and R and may begin construction.

    4. Partial Complete: application at status U and X, and CO issued for NB or A1 job type, and the CO is a Temporary CO AND less than 80% of the units are completed for a building with 20 or more units.

    5. Complete: For new buildings and alterations, application is at status U and X, or a CO has been issued. For demolitions, the application is at status X. DCP has decided to mark demolitions as complete when they reach status X, but list the completion date as equal to status Q because this is likely when the building must be vacated, and it appears that many buildings are physically demolished some time before receiving sign off (status X).

    9. Withdrawn: application is at status 3. The application has been withdrawn by the applicant.
  example: 5. Completed Construction
  values:
  - value: 1. Filed Application
  - value: 2. Approved Application
  - value: 3. Permitted for Construction
  - value: 4. Partially Completed Construction
  - value: 5. Completed Construction
