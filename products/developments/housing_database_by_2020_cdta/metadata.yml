    Net change in housing units arising from new buildings, demolitions, or alterations for NYC Community District Tabulation
    Areas (CDTAs) since 2010. The NYC Department of City Planning's (DCP) <a
    href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-housing-database.page#housingdevelopmentproject">Housing
    Database</a> provide the 2010 census count of housing units, the net change in Class A housing units since the census, and the
    count of units pending completion for commonly used political and statistical boundaries. These tables are aggregated from the
    DCP Housing Database, which is derived from Department of Buildings (DOB)-approved housing construction and demolition jobs
    filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is calculated as the sum of all three construction
    job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to
    determine the change in legal housing units across time and space.
