    The NYC Department of City Planning's (DCP)  <a href =
    "https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-housing-database.page#housingdevelopmentproject">Housing
    Database</a>  contains all NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or
    completed in NYC since January 1, 2010.  It includes the three primary construction job types that add or remove residential
    units: new buildings, major alterations, and demolitions, and can be used to determine the change in legal housing units
    across time and space. Records in the Housing Database Project-Level Files are geocoded to the greatest level of precision
    possible, subject to numerous quality assurance and control checks, recoded for usability, and joined to other housing data
    sources relevant to city planners and analysts.

    Data are updated semiannually, at the end of the second and fourth quarters of each year.

    Please see DCP's annual Housing Production Snapshot summarizing findings from the 21Q4 data release <a
    href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1c9138dc24064b2e8142ff156345a719">here</a>.  Additional Housing and Economic
    analyses are also <a

    The NYC Department of City Planning's (DCP) <a
    href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-housing-database.page#housingdevelopmentunit">Housing Database
    Unit Change Summary Files</a> provide the net change in Class A housing units since 2010, and the count of units pending
    completion for commonly used political and statistical boundaries (Census Block, Census Tract, City Council district,
    Community District, Community District Tabulation Area (CDTA), Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA). These tables are aggregated
    from the DCP Housing Database Project-Level Files, which is derived from Department of Buildings (DOB) approved housing
    construction and demolition jobs filed or completed in NYC since January 1, 2010. Net housing unit change is calculated as the
    sum of all three construction job types that add or remove residential units: new buildings, major alterations, and
    demolitions. These files can be used to determine the change in legal housing units across time and space.

    All previously released versions of this data are available on the <a href="{{ bytes_url__housing_database }}">DCP Website: BYTES of the BIG APPLE</a>.
