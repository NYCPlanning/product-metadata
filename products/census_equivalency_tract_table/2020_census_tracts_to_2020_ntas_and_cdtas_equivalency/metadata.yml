  description: This file shows the relationship between New York City’s 2020 census
    tracts, 2020 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs), and Community District Tabulation
    Areas (CDTAs). 2020 census tracts nest within 2020 NTAs, and 2020 NTAs nest within
    CDTAs, so each census tract is listed only once. Note that CDTAs sometimes cross
    borough boundaries, and therefore will not add up to borough totals for the Bronx,
    Queens, and Manhattan. As they are nested within CDTAs, NTAs will likewise not
    add up to borough totals. Also note that census tracts in New York City’s water
    areas are excluded from this file.
