  GIS data:  A single line street base map representing the city's streets
  and other linear geographic features, along with feature names and address ranges
  for each addressable street segment.  This dataset includes the Nodes file.  The
  Nodes file contains a point feature and unique NodeID for each node that exists
  in the LION file. The Node_StreetName.txt file lists the street names associated
  with those nodes. Most nodes, representing intersections, will have at least 2
  street names associated in the Node_StreetName.txt file.


  All previously released versions of this data are available at <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts%5Byear%5D=0">BYTES of the BIG APPLE- Archive</a>.
