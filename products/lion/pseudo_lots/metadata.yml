description: >
  The Pseudo Lots dataset contains polygons of locations that have an address
  and/or a structure with a building identification number (BIN), but for which there
  is no tax lot. Pseudo lots may exist for locations with open space, subway or train
  stations, skyways, tunnels, or other miscellaneous features. Note that this is not
  a comprehensive dataset of locations with these types of features.
