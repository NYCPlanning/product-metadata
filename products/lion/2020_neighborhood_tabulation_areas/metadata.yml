description: >
  2020 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) are medium-sized statistical
  geographies for reporting Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS).
  2020 NTAs are created by aggregating 2020 census tracts and nest within Community
  District Tabulation Areas (CDTA). NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic
  specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Consequently, each NTA contains
  enough population to mitigate sampling error associated with the ACS yet offers
  a unit of analysis that is smaller than a Community District.


  Though NTA boundaries and their associated names roughly correspond with many neighborhoods
  commonly recognized by New Yorkers, NTAs are not intended to definitively represent
  neighborhoods, nor are they intended to be exhaustive of all possible names and
  understandings of neighborhoods throughout New York City. Additionally, non-residential
  areas including large parks, airports, cemeteries, and other special areas are represented
  separately within this dataset and are assigned codes according to their type (See
  NTAType field). All previously released versions of this data are available at <a
  href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts%5Byear%5D=0">BYTES
  of the BIG APPLE- Archive</a>.
