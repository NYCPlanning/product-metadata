  The 2010 NYC Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are statistical geographic
  areas defined for the dissemination of Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data.
  PUMAs have a minimum population of 100,000 and were aggregated from 2010 census
  tracts. These boundary files are derived from the US Census Bureau's TIGER project
  and have been geographically modified to fit the New York City base map.
