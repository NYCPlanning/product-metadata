        Census Blocks from the 2020 US Census for New York City clipped to the shoreline. These boundary files are derived from the US Census Bureau's TIGER project and have been geographically modified to fit the New York City base map. Because some census blocks are under water not all census blocks are contained in this file, only census blocks that are partially or totally located on land have been mapped in this file.
