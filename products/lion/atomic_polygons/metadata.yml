description: >
  Atomic polygons serve as a set of basic building blocks for generating
  the polygons of many of the district types represented in the CSCL database. Feature
  classes such as election district, school district, census block, FDNY administrative
  company, and community district can be dissolved by combining the appropriate
  fields in atomic polygons.
