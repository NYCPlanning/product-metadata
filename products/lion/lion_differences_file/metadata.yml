description: >
  The LION Differences File (LDF) documents segment and node level changes
  that have occurred in the LION file between two subsequent releases. This file
  allows a user who "ties" organizational data to DCP's Segment ID
  and/or Node ID to migrate their data appropriately when these changes occur.

  All previously released versions of this data are available at <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts%5Byear%5D=0">BYTES of the BIG APPLE- Archive</a>.
