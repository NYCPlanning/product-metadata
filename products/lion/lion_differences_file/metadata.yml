    The LION Differences File (LDF) documents segment and node level changes that have occurred in the LION file between two subsequent releases. This file allows a user who "ties" organizational data to DCP's Segment ID and/or Node ID to migrate their data appropriately when these changes occur.
    All previously released versions of this data are available at <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts%5Byear%5D=0">BYTES of the BIG APPLE- Archive</a>.
