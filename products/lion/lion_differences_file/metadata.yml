    The LION Differences File (LDF) documents segment and node level changes that have occurred in the LION file between two subsequent releases. This file allows a user who "ties" organizational data to DCP's Segment ID and/or Node ID to migrate their data appropriately when these changes occur.

    All previously released versions of this data are available on the <a href="{{ bytes_lion_urls__lion_diff }}">DCP Website: BYTES of the BIG APPLE</a>. Current version: {{ version }}
