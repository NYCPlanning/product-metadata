  GIS data: Community Districts


  Community Districts are mandated by the city charter to review and monitor quality of life
  issues for New York City (NYC) neighborhoods.  NYC is currently comprised of 59
  community districts. The first byte is a borough code and the second and third
  bytes are the community district number. There are also 12 Joint Interest Areas
  (JIAs).  The JIAs are major parks and airports and are not contained within any
  community district.   This dataset is being provided by the Department of City
  Planning (DCP) for informational purposes only. DCP does not warranty the completeness,
  accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of the dataset,
  nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with respect to the dataset
  as furnished on the website. DCP and the City are not liable for any deficiencies
  in the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose
  or use the dataset, or applications utilizing the dataset, provided by any third
  party.
