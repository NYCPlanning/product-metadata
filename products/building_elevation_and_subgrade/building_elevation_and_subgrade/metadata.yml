  description: The Building Elevation and Subgrade data contains New York City building
    centroids derived from the Department of Building's (DOB) February 26th, 2022
    building footprint dataset. Each record contains a grade and first floor measurement
    for each building (recorded as feet above sea-level in the NADV88 vertical datum)
    and indicates if subgrade space exists. DCP contracted with an external data vendor
    to generate a single point, or centroid, that represented the location of the
    center of every building recorded in the DOB dataset. The dataset excluded the
    footprints of small accessory buildings such as sheds. Each row within the dataset
    represents one building centroid, and records the X and Y coordinates of that
    centroid in the NAD 1983 coordinate system.
