    ULURLP number for  application associated with the zoning map amendment.

    A nine to ten digit string. The first six charaters are numbers, starting with a two digit year the application was filed, followed by a two letter ULURP application abbreviation, then a one letter borough code.

    Ten digit ULURP numbers are for modified applications. If an application is modified it receives a new ULURP number with a letter between the first six numbers and last three letters, starting with "a" for the first modification and changing to the next letter for each time it is modified. (i.e., 991234zmm,991234azmm, 991234bzmm, etc.)

    Does not contain the ULURP prefix for status.
  notes: |
    ULURP = Uniform Land Use Review Procedure

    ULURP Borough Codes:
    K = Brooklyn (Kings)
    M = Manhattan
    Q = Queens
    R = Staten Island (Richmond)
    X = Bronx
    Y = Citywide or more than one Borough
