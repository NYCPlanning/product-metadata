  description: |-
    Special purpose districts have regulations that supplement and modify
    the underlying zoning for distinctive neighborhoods with particular issues and
    goals. The district designation is indicated in the SDNAME attribute. The abbreviation
    as shown on the zoning map is indicated in the SDLBL attribute. See also Special
    Purpose Subdistricts, which contains both the main special purpose district boundaries
    and the internal subdistricts. Subdistrict data has not been fully digitized and
    may be incomplete. See the Zoning Resolution for a complete description of the
    special purpose district. Where appropriate, the Zoning Resolution includes a
    district map showing subdistricts and subareas within the special purpose district.
    
    All previously released versions of this data are available on the <a href="{{ bytes_url__zoning_features }}">DCP Website: BYTES of the BIG APPLE</a>.
