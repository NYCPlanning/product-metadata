description: >
  The Georeferenced NYC Zoning Maps raster dataset is intended to be a
  spatial representation of the entire zoning map catalog for the City of New York
  as one seamless citywide raster zoning map sans title blocks. These maps are normally
  maintained as 126 individual quarter sections and printed periodically for inclusion
  in Vol III of the City\u2019s Zoning Resolution. This dataset encompasses recent
  changes to mapped zoning districts or zoning text amendments as they are adopted
  by the City Council as well as filed City Map changes.


  All previously released versions of this data are available at <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts%5Byear%5D=0">BYTES of the BIG APPLE- Archive</a>
