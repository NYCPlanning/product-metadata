    A section of the zoning map index.
    Zoning maps show the boundaries of zoning districts throughout the city. The set of
    126 maps, which are part of the Zoning Resolution, are displayed in 35 sections. Each
    section is identified by a number from 1 to 35.
    Sections are further divided into four quarters (quartersections). The combination of
    section number and quartersection letter is used to determine which zoning map (map
    8d or 33c for example) is related to a specific geographic area in New York City.
    Sections are roughly 16,000 feet (north/south) by 25,000 feet (east/west) or 400
    million SF.
