    Shapefile of zoning quartersection map index. Grid to determine which
    zoning quartersection map relates to specific areas of NYC.

    A sectional index grid to determine which Zoning Map refers to specific areas of New York
    City. Zoning maps show the boundaries of zoning districts throughout the city.
    The maps are regularly updated after the City Planning Commission and the City
    Council have approved proposed zoning changes. The set of 126 maps, which are
    part of the Zoning Resolution, are displayed in 35 sections. Each section is
    identified by a number from 1 to 35 and is further divided into one to four
    quarters, each identified by a letter a, b, c or d (map 8d or 33c for example).
    Each map covers an area of approximately 8,000 feet (north/south) by 12,500
    feet (east/west).

    A quartersection of the zoning map index labeled by a letter identifying a quartersection.
    Zoning maps show the boundaries of zoning districts throughout the city. The set of
    126 maps, which are part of the Zoning Resolution, are displayed in 35 sections. Each
    section is identified by a number from 1 to 35. Sections are further divided into four
    quarter (quartersections), each identified by a letter a, b, c or d.
    The combination of section number and quartersection letter is used to determine
    which zoning map (map 8d or 33c for example) is related to a specific geographic area
    in New York City. Sections are approximately 8,000 feet (north/south) by 12,500 feet
    (east/west) or 100 million SF.
