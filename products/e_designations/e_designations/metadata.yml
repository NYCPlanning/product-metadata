    This data set contains information and locations of (E) Designations, including CEQR Environment Requirements (Table 1) and CEQR Restrictive Declarations (Table 2), in Appendix C of the Zoning Resolution. An (E) Designation provides notice of the presence of an environmental requirement pertaining to potential hazardous materials contamination, high ambient noise levels or air emission concerns on a particular tax lot.
