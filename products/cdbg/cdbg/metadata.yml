    The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires local
    municipalities that receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG or CD) formula
    Entitlement funds to use the 5-year 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) Low
    and Moderate Income Summary Data (LMISD) data file to determine where CDBG funds may
    be used for activities that are available to all the residents in a particular area
    ("CD area benefit" or "CD-eligible area"). A CD-eligible census tract refers to 2020
    census tracts where the area is primarily residential in nature and at least 51.00%
    of the residents are low- and moderate-income persons as per the LMISD data file.
    For New York City, a primarily residential area is defined as one where at least
    50.00% of the total built floor area is residential. Low- and moderate-income
    persons are defined as persons living in households with incomes below 80 percent of
    the area median household income (AMI).

    In addition, floor area percentages have been updated with the most recent floor
    area data (PLUTO 24v4).

    Persons who are interested in determining their individual household eligibility for
    CD-funded programs should refer to <a
    href='https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html'>HUD's household low- and
    moderate-income limits for the given year.</a>
