    The Waterfront Access Map (WAM) data contains information about waterfront
    areas accessible to the public that are either publicly owned or on private property.
    The Waterfront Public Access Areas (WPAA)s data contains privately owned waterfront
    zoning lots where publicly accessible open space is provided to and along the
    shoreline for public enjoyment. The Publicly Owned Waterfront data contains City,
    State, and Federally owned public parks and facilities that provide waterfront
    parkland and open space for public enjoyment. Data for WPAA footprints and access
    points, human powered boat launches and saltwater fishing access are also included.

    All previously released versions of this data are available on the <a href="{{ bytes_url__waterfront_public_access_areas }}">DCP Website: BYTES of the BIG APPLE</a>. Current version: {{ version }}
